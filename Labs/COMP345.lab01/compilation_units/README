This folder contains:

A.h
A.cpp
B.h
B.cpp
C.h
C.cpp

If you compile all of them:

g++ *.cpp

then you have redefined symbols, as both A.cpp and B.cpp contain a main() function, which creates a linker error. 

If you compile A.cpp and C.cpp:

g++ A.cpp C.cpp

upon exection you get:

Executing A.cpp's main function
Executing cff()
Executing C::C(2)
Executing C::cmf(1)

If you compile B.cpp and C.cpp:

g++ B.cpp C.cpp

upon execution you get:

Executing B.cpp's main function
